                About <b>vaccination</b> process</h1><br>India’s drugs regulator has approved Oxford Institute’s
            COVID-19 vaccine Covishield, which is being developed by the Pune-based Serum Institute,
            and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, for emergency use in the country, which means that India will roll out a
            massive vaccination drive against COVID-19 in the coming days. According to Drug Controller General of India
            VG Somani,
            the overall efficacy of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine was 70.42 per cent while Bharat Biotech’s COVAXIN was
            “safe and provides a robust immune response.” In the run up to a massive coronavirus vaccination drive,
            dry-run has already been held across states and Union Territories on January 2 to assess operational
            feasibility, to test the linkages between planning
            and implementation and to identify the challenges and guide way forward prior to actual implementation.

            <h5 style="background-color: bisque;">What Is The Duration Of Immunity After Taking The Vaccine</h5>
            Explaining the efficacy of Coronavirus vaccine, Dr Shekhar C Mande, Director General, Council of Scientific
            & Industrial Research said,

            The duration of immunity is still an open question because the disease is only 11-months old now. The first
            of the vaccines trials that began, especially the phase-3 began in July and August, so as of now, we don’t
            know how long the person will be immune to the disease with the vaccine. But all this will be known very
            soon as we progress to different stages.
            And this answer will only define, whether we need to take vaccine every year or periodically. But
            nonetheless, we don’t need to worry about that as of now. We have to just think that we all need to take the
            two shots of the vaccine – one at day 1 and other at day 28.

                    share thinks they are ineffective? And what share denies their importance? In this post we present
                    the global data on attitudes to vaccination. Here is a summary of the results:</p>
                <div class="col-4">
                    <h4 class="inside">Most people in the world think vaccines are important for children to have</h4>
                    92% of people in the world think vaccines are important for children to have;
                    7% of people globally disagree that vaccines are safe. But this differs considerably between
                    different countries: France topped the list with 33% disagreeing;
                    Globally, 5% of people disagree that vaccines are effective. But skepticism is high in some
                    countries, ranging from 28% in Liberia to less than 1% in Bangladesh and Egypt;
                    In many countries few people disagree that vaccines are safe and effective, but the share of people
                    who “neither agree nor disagree” can be more than 50%.
                    COVID vaccine for children is now a reality in the USA, where the Centers for Disease Control and
                    Prevention has recommended expanding usage of Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine for children
                    between 12-15 years of age. President Joe Biden has called the move “one more giant step in our
                    fight against the pandemic.”

                <div class="col-4">
                    <h4 class="inside">Most people in the world think vaccines are safe, but mistrust is high in some
                        countries</h4>Some parents may not agree for children to be vaccinated if they think vaccines
                    are unsafe or could potentially cause side-effects which are worse than the benefits. How prevalent
                    are these safety concerns?

                    Globally, a small share of people disagree that vaccines are safe. Only 7% of respondents across the
                    world said they “strongly disagree” or “somewhat disagree” with the statement ‘Vaccines are safe’.

                    In many countries these concerns are very low: in Bangladesh, for example, less than 1% disagree
                    that vaccines are safe. In neighbouring India, only 2% disagree. We see this distribution across the
                    world in the map.

                    Trust in vaccines is not high everywhere. The French were most skeptical: 1-in-3 disagreed that
                    vaccines were safe. Many in neighbouring Switzerland and Belgium were also very skeptical: more than
                    20% disagreed. Other countries with high mistrust of vaccine safety were Gabon (26%); Togo (25%);
                    Russia (24%); Austria (21%), and Iceland (21%).

                <div class="col-4">
                    <h4 class="inside">Only 5% of respondents globally disagree that vaccines are effective but
                        skepticism is much higher in some countries</h4>In response to the statement ‘Vaccines are
                    effective’, only 5% of respondents across all surveyed countries said they “strongly disagree” or
                    “somewhat disagree”. The vast majority of people do not think of vaccines as ineffective.

                    But, as with the other surveyed questions, this varies significantly across countries. We see this
                    in the map. In some countries, very few respondents disagreed: less than 1% in Bangladesh and Egypt;
                    2% in India and Ethiopia; and 3% in China, Germany and the UK.

                    Liberia is most skeptical with 28% disagreeing that vaccines are effective. But skepticism was also
                    high in France (18%); Namibia (16%); Nigeria (16%); and Peru (15%).

                Here’s All You Need To Know About India’s COVID-19 Vaccination Drive:</h4>
            <h6>Who Will Get The Vaccine First?</h6>1. One Crore Healthcare Workers

            In the phase one of the coronavirus vaccination drive in the country, the COVID-19 vaccine will first be
            given to around one crore healthcare workers working in both government and private hospitals, according to
            the recommendation by the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (NEGVAC). Health
            Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan had also said the same while informing the public about India’s COVID-19
            vaccination drive. He had said,
            “In 1st phase of COVID-19 Vaccination drive, free vaccine will be provided across the nation to most
            prioritised beneficiaries that include 1 crore healthcare workers.” <br>
            2. Two Crore Frontline and Municipal Workers
            In the phase-1 of coronavirus vaccination drive, after the healthcare workers comes other frontline warriors
            and municipal workers. Around two crore frontline workers such as state and central Police department, armed
            forces, home guard, disaster management and civil defense organisation, prison staff, municipal workers and
            revenue officials engaged in COVID-19 containment, surveillance and associated activities will get the COVID
            vaccine.<br>
            3. Population Above 50 Years Of Age
            This group is divided into two sub-categories: Above 60 and 50-60 years of age. <br>
            4. Areas With High COVID-19 Infection / People With Comorbidities
            Next in line will be areas or identified priority groups (as decided by the NEGVAC) in identified
            geographical areas where the COVID-19 infection prevalence is high, followed by people who have
            comorbidities.<br>
            5. Rest Of The Population
        </div>
        <div class="col-2">
            <h4 style="color:tomato;">How To Register Yourself For COVID-19 Vaccine?</h4>Self-registration module will
            be made available in the later phases of the implementation of the vaccine drive. The general public, which
            is not in the priority list will have to self-register themselves on the CoWIN website/app. They will have
            to upload a government photo identity or do an AADHAAR authentication. The authentication can happen via
            biometrics, OTP (one time password) or demographic. Once the registration is done, a date and time will be
            allocated for vaccination. There will be no on the spot registration and only pre-registered beneficiaries
            will be allowed to proceed for the vaccination.<br>
            <h6 style="background-color: bisque;">Vaccination Sites: Where You Will Get Vaccinated</h6>Fixed Session
            Site: These sites include health facilities – both government and private – where either a medical officer
            or a doctor is available is defined as a fixed session site
            Outreach Session Site: Locations other than health facilities such as schools, community halls, come under
            this list
            Special Mobile Team: For remote, hard-to-reach areas, migratory populations areas and international borders
            areas, district administrations will plan the vaccination drive via the special mobile team<br>
            <h6 style="background-color: bisque;">The Vaccination Process: What To Expect
            </h6>
            The vaccination site will have three rooms:

            Waiting room: Where one will wait before you get the vaccine
            Vaccination room: A place where you will be given the vaccine
            Observation room: An area where you will be observed for 30 minutes post receiving the vaccine
            A five-member vaccination team will be entrusted with the process:

            Vaccination officer 1: For pre-checking the registration
            Vaccination officer 2: For authentication
            Vaccination officer 3: In-charge of giving vaccine. Since it is an intramuscular vaccine, a trained
            professional will administer the vaccine
            Vaccination officer 4 and 5: In-charge of crowd management and 30-minute observation
